# Eventbrite QR Code

EventbriteQRCode is a javascript web application developed by students from HZ University of Applied Sciences.\
It allows you to read and display the data held by a QR code and to indicate the first and last name of its owner.

## Installation

If you want to run the application locally, you might need to install the live-server extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

 or install the package with npm:
```bash
npm install live-server
live-server .
```

## Usage

When connecting to the website for the first time, insert your API key in the prompt. When an API key is set, you just need to present a QR code Eventbrite in front of the webcam.

In case a wrong API key was given, press `a` to change the value.
